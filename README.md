# React Native Sandbox

React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, nativley rendering iOS and Android mobile applications. It is based on the React library created by Facebook for building user interfaces. We can use React Native to write clean, fast mobile apps from the comfort of a familiar framework. 

An important question to consider: Is the code we write in React Native trully native? 

The answer is yes! In React, the component describes its own appearance; React then handles the rendering for you. React uses a seamless abstraction layer ("bridge") in between these two tasks to invoke the actual rendering of APIs on iOS and Android. 

## Set up and Terminal commands to get going

React Native relies on the following dependencies:
1. XCode 
1. 

```
react-native run-ios
```
